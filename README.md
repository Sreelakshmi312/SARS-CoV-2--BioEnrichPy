# KEGG Pathway Enrichment Visualization

This repository contains a Python script to visualize KEGG pathway enrichment results using horizontal bar plots. The plot highlights statistically significant pathways based on FDR-adjusted p-values.

---

## 📂 Files

- `plot_kegg_enrichment.py`: Main script for filtering and plotting enriched KEGG pathways.
- `kegg_enrichment_results.csv`: Input file with KEGG pathway enrichment results.
- `kegg_pathways_Plot.jpeg`: Output plot image generated by the script.

---

## 📊 What the Script Does

1. Loads a CSV file containing KEGG enrichment results.
2. Converts the p-values into numeric format.
3. Filters pathways with FDR-adjusted p-value ≤ 0.01.
4. Plots the pathways using `-log10(p-value)` as bar lengths.
5. Saves the output as a high-resolution JPEG image.

## 🧪 Requirements

Make sure the following Python packages are installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
```

---

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
python plot_kegg_enrichment.py
```

Make sure the `kegg_enrichment_results.csv` file is in the same directory, or update the file path in the script accordingly.

---

## 🖼️ Output

The output image `kegg_pathways_Plot.jpeg` will be saved in the same folder. It shows enriched pathways with a p-value ≤ 0.01, sorted by significance.
